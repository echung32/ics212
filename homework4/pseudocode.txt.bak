addRecord

*** Assume the following variables are already defined. ***

- start: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL)
- uaccountno: The user's account number (integer)
- uname: a character array containing the user's name
- uaddress: a character array containing the user's address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

define a pointer to a record called curr

allocate a heap space and store its address into curr

if( start is equal to NULL )
    # init the first address
    copy from uaccountno to accountno in the record whose address is in curr
    copy from uname to name in the record whose address is in curr
    copy from uaddress to address in the record whose address is in curr
    copy from NULL to next in the record whose address is in curr
    copy from curr to start
else
    # has data already
    copy from start to curr
    while( uaccountno is less than accountno in the record whose address is in curr )
        if ( next in the record whose address is in curr is NULL )
            # reached the tail
            copy from 
        copy from start to curr
        copy from uaccountno to accountno in the record whose address is in curr
        copy from uname to name in the record whose address is in curr
        copy from uaddress to address in the record whose address is in curr
        copy from NULL to next in the record whose address is in curr
