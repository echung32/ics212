addRecord

*** Assume the following variables are already defined. ***

- start: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL)
- uaccountno: The user's account number (integer)
- uname: a character array containing the user's name
- uaddress: a character array containing the user's address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

define a pointer to a record called temp

allocate a heap space and store its address into temp

copy from uaccountno to accountno in the record whose address is in temp
copy from uname to name in the record whose address is in temp
copy from uaddress to address in the record whose address is in temp
copy from NULL to next in the record whose address is in temp

if ( start == NULL )
    copy from temp to start
else
    define a pointer to a record called curr
    define an int called exit
    copy from start to curr
    copy from 0 to exit
    do
        if ( next in the record whose address is in curr == NULL )
            if ( accountno in the record whose address is temp <= accountno in the record whose address is in start )
                copy from start to next in the record whose address is in temp
                copy from temp to start
            else
                copy from temp to next in the record whose address is in curr
            copy from 1 to exit
        else if ( accountno in the record whose address is in temp > the accountno in the record whose address is in curr )
            copy from next in the record whose address is in curr to curr
        else
            copy from next in the record whose address is in curr to next in the record whose address is in temp
