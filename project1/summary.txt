I have concluded my testing for the "project1" program. Test results are available in the "textplan.xlsx" file.

Overall, no significant issues were found which prevent the program from being used, and no crashes were experienced. However, some minor issues were found:

- the `cat database.txt` step expects nothing to be returned, yet a newline is printed. However, the program still functioned, so there should be no issue with this.
- when deleting an accountno with multiple accounts, the message returned does not indicate whether it has deleted only one, or multiple accounts. This may lead to confusion.

This concludes my report.
