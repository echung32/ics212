All requirements were met, and all components are functional,
with the exception of the potential for user input functions
to cause unintentional errors. However, the current test cases
for this program prove the program to be fine.

A copy constructor and an assignment operator was implemented,
and is tested on startup when using the debug release. An issue
which was encountered is that both copy and assignment will use
the same filename as the original, thus causing conflicting
writes on exit.

A couple of compromises were made due to the assignment instructions.
- No additional helper methods could be created, which lead to
duplication of code in certain functions in the `llist.cpp` file.
- A constraint of 1 #ifdef per function also made it necessary to
duplicate code in certain functions.
- The filename for copy/assignment is hardcoded to prevent write
conflicts, but this also means copy/assignment can only be unique
once. In the future, the filename should be adjustable even after
initialization, allowing the user to choose the desired behavior.
